# Stremio Premiumize Files Addon

![showcase](/images/showcase.jpg)

This addon lets you connect your [Premiumize](https://www.premiumize.me/) files and watch them directly in [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/). You can choose a specific folder to use as your library, or use your Premiumize root folder by default.

The addon automatically organizes your content into Stremio catalogs:
- **Movie Catalog:** If a folder contains mostly video files, it is shown as a movie catalog.
- **Series Catalog:** If a folder contains mostly subfolders, it is shown as a series catalog. Series episodes must be named with the format `SXXEXX` (for example, `S01E02`).

You can also integrate your files with TMDB or AIOLists catalogs by naming your files or folders like this:
- For movies: `NAME [IMDBID-TMDBID]`
- For series episodes: `NAME SXXEXX [IMDBID-TMDBID]`

Optionally, you can add an API key from [Rating Poster Database (RPDB)](https://ratingposterdb.com/) to show posters in your catalogs.

*This Addon is inspired by [Viren070's GDrive Addon](https://github.com/Viren070/stremio-gdrive-addon)*

**Tips:**
- For best results and metadata, add the `[IMDBID-TMDBID]` format in your file and folder names.
- Series episodes must include the `SXXEXX` pattern (e.g., `S01E02`) at the end of the filename.
- Files and folders without IDs will only show on the Addon catalogs, and won't have posters or rich metadata.
